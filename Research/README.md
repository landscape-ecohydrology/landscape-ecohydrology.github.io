The sustainable management of our water resources is complex and often requires interdisciplinary approaches to understand. Our research is often at the interface of hydrology, biogeochemistry, and ecology, with the goal of producing relevant knowledge to help inform stakeholders.

Our current research broadly covers the following topics:

* [Wetlandscape Ecohydrology]{:.heading.flip-title}
* [Emerging Contaminants in Agroecosystems]{:.heading.flip-title} 
* [Carbon-Nitrogen Cycling in Reactive Interfaces]{:.heading.flip-title} 
* Linkages Between Inland and Coastal Water Quality
