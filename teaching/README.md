I will be tentatively teaching the following courses on rotation at the University of Virginia starting in Fall 2024:

-   EVSC 3600: Physical Hydrology (Fall 2024)

-   EVHY 5559: Environmental Water Quality (Spring 2025; spring in odd years)

-   EVHY 5559: Watershed Restoration (Spring 2025; co-instructor with Reidenbach)

-   EVSC 5559: Introduction to Environmental Modelling (Fall 2025; fall in odd years)

-   Seminar: Communicating with Environmental Data (TBD)

-   Seminar: Watershed Biogeochemistry (TBD)

Course codes and syllabi will be updated prior to the first offering of the course.

## Teaching Philosophy

The natural world is complex - scientists and engineers often need a strong foundation in data wrangling and quantitative skills to help them understand the interdisciplinary nature of environmental systems. My goal as an instructor is to help facilitate a positive learning environment where students can master these skills while appreciating the need for effective communication and visualizations.

Below is a collection of content, visualizations, etc. that I've used for lectures I've taught. These pages are still a work in progress; let me know if you have any questions or would like to include something in your own courses!
