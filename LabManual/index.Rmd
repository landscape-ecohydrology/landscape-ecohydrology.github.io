# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Hello! My hope is that this document is 1) a social contract between Fred and yourself, and between the research group, and 2) a way to on-ramp newcomers to the lab culture and workflow. My hope is that we can all strive towards the expectations and ideals in this document so that we can learn and conduct research in a safe and supportive environment.

More importantly, I do not consider this document to be a substitute for discourse within our group. Rather, this document is here to 1) remind us of what we've discussed and be something we can refer back to, and 2) serve as a jumping point to deeper conversations. Finally, this document is a *living document* and I hope that all members of our research group will contribute their own ideas to improve our group, tell me what isn't working, and share tips and tricks for future members.

There's a lot of information here - I suggest reading the following sections based on your interaction with our research group

|                               |                                                   |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Prospective lab member        | Sections 1-2                                      |
| New member about to join      | Section 3 (as well as 1-2 if you haven't already) |
| Current lab member, as needed | Sections 4 and beyond                             |

## Render book {.unnumbered}

You can build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

## Preview book {.unnumbered}

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
