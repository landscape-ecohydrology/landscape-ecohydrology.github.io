I will be tentatively teaching the following courses on rotation at the University of Virginia starting in Fall 2024:

-   EVSC 3600 - Physical Hydrology

-   Environmental Water Quality

-   Introduction to Environmental Modelling

-   Communicating with Environmental Data (Seminar)

Course codes and syllabi will be updated prior to the first offering of the course.

## Teaching Philosophy

The natural world is complex - scientists and engineers often need a strong foundation in data wrangling and quantitative skills to help them understand the interdisciplinary nature of environmental systems. My goal as an instructor is to help facilitate a positive learning environment where students can master these skills while appreciating the need for effective communication and visualizations.

Below is a collection of content, visualizations, etc. that I've used for lectures I've taught. These pages are still a work in progress; let me know if you have any questions or would like to include something in your own courses!
