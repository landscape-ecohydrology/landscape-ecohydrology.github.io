The sustainable management of our water resources is complex and often requires interdisciplinary approaches to understand. My research is often at the interface of hydrology, biogeochemistry, and ecology, with the goal of producing relevant knowledge to help inform stakeolders.

My current research broadly covers the following topics:

* [Wetlandscape Ecohydrology]{:.heading.flip-title}
* [Emerging Contaminants in Agroecosystems]{:.heading.flip-title} 
* [Carbon-Nitrogen Cycling in Reactive Interfaces]{:.heading.flip-title} 
* Landscape Controls on Catchment Salinization
