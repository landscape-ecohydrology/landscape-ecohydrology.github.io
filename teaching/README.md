The natural world is complex - scientists and engineers often need a strong foundation in data wrangling and quantitative skills to help them understand the interdisciplinary nature of environmental systems. My goal as an instructor is to help facilitate a positive learning environment where students can master these skills while appreciating the necessity of effective communication and visualizations.

Below is a collection of content, visualizations, etc. that I've used for lectures I've taught. These pages are still a work in progress; let me know if you have any questions or would like to include something in your own courses!
