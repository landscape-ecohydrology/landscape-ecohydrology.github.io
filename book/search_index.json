My hope is that we can all strive towards the expectations and ideals in this document so that we can learn and conduct research in a safe and supportive environment. More importantly, I do not consider this document to be a substitute for discourse within our group. Rather, this document is here to 1) remind us of what we’ve discussed and be something we can refer back to, and 2) serve as a jumping point to deeper conversations. Finally, this document is a living document and I hope that all members of our research group will contribute their own ideas to improve our group, tell me what isn’t working, and share tips and tricks for future members. There’s a lot of information here - I suggest reading the following sections based on your interaction with our research group Prospective lab member Sections 1-2 New member about to join Section 3 (as well as 1-2 if you haven’t already) Current lab member, as needed Sections 4 and beyond Contents of this document are heavily inspired by x,y,z.

Text text text interdisciplinary work at the intersection of hydrology and biogeochemistry broadly focused on how water quantity and quality is modified at different spatial (local site to watershed to continental) and temporal (sub-daily to decadal) scales. This work has the goal of helping stakeholders and communities address water issues, and develop understanding and/or tools to help them manage their water resources. 1.2 Who are we? I envision our group to be a vibrant group of researchers from diverse backgrounds (both in life and previous academic training) working together to understand the causes and towards solutions to complex socio-environmental phenomena. We use a variety of tools to tackle these problems - we use primarily computational techniques from data synthesis, numerical modeling, remote sensing, and machine learning. We work at the intersection of many fields and our combined expertise comes from areas such as environmental engineering, biogeochemistry, ecohydrology, geography, economics, and more! A bit about me Originally from Canada, I started my academic career studying to be an environmental engineer at the University of Waterloo. I originally didn’t consider a career in research and was set on becoming an engineer after graduation. After a stroke of luck, I spent a term as an undergraduate researcher with Dr. Nandita Basu and found myself drawn to the research process. Thanks to the great mentorship and community in the research group, I stayed and completed my graduate degrees there as well, studying the role of surface water-groundwater interactions on biogeochemical processes. After graduation, I went to Colorado State University to work with Dr. Matt Ross to develop process-guided deep learning models to predict Group Members XXXX For current members and alumni, check out our website!

Conducting research can be a long journey with ups and downs, and I want to cultivate an environment that is supportive and enriching for all our members. Note that this will be expanded when we fill out our mentorship agreement provided by the department, and discussed when you arrive at UVA. 2.1 Values in our lab Mutual Respect and Equity: XXX Openness/Vulnerability: XXX Growth Well-being be kind to yourself and others 2.2 Fundamental Expectations My commitment to you as a mentor I truly believe that I am successful only when my mentees are thriving while producing good science. I want to be clear that my students aren’t ‘number of publications’ before they graduate and I want to help you be successful during and after your graduate training by giving you the necessary support and opportunities. To achieve this, I will: Provide you guidance on your research project while encouraging intellectual curiosity and freedom Ensure that you have sufficient funding throughout your tenure in our research group Establish a meeting frequency that suits your current needs and stage of progress Help shape your graduate training to ensure that you learn the appropriate technical skills and develop the soft skills necessary for your desired career goals Help shape your graduate training so that you’re on the path to becoming an independent scientist by the time you graduate from the group Provide support and mutually establish expectations to ensure you have a good work-life balance/whole student experience Encourage you, and highlight opportunities, to expand your academic and support network while at UVA and beyond. My expectations of lab members Conduct research with integrity and respect. Share both achievements and setbacks. Research is full of ups and downs and I want to normalize both big and small failures, and celebrate successes when we get them. You should also keep track of activities in your CV for departmental reporting and future purposes. Keep track of necessary administrative deadlines and degree requirements to ensure timely graduation and try to let me know with a reasonable buffer. I will do my best to remember general deadlines to keep you on track, but ultimately, it is more efficient if you remind me of anything you need me to do, read over, sign, etc. Be open collaborators and show interest beyond your own research project. Research is rarely done alone in our field. If I think you will benefit with collaborating with another researcher, I will give you space to work with them and ensure you get credit There are also opportunities to mentor undergraduate students at UVA. This can be a mutually beneficial arrangement where you can hone your mentorship skills while getting research tasks completed, while helping an undergraduate student gain new skills. Pursue an average of 1 external funding opportunities per year (e.g. GFRP, travel grants, scientific union/conference awards). These are good skills to develop and many materials are reusable either for your own dissertation or future applications. I hope to pass along opportunities and will help you with applications; you are not obligated to pursue every single one. Work towards a healthy work-life balance (see below!). Easy to say, more difficult to do but having burnout doesn’t do favours for anyone! Contribute to the lab handbook to establish expectations, share experiences, etc. 2.3 Research Expectations and Outcomes In line with expectations in our field and the department, graduate students should expect to have one (master’s students) or three (PhD students) first-author papers published or near submission prior to their graduation. Note that this is in excess of the minimum requirements from the department, but this will ensure a strong defense by graduation. My goal is to provide full funding for one major conference per year after you have reached the stage of near-publication for one chapter of your work. I also expect you to present your work at local/regional opportunities prior to that to develop your skills. Typical major conferences that I go to (not necessarily every year) are AGU Fall Meeting, Society of Freshwater Science Meeting, ASLO. Local/regional opportunities include: TBD. 2.4 How much work should I put in? For better or for worse, there can always be more to do in research: read one more paper, conduct more analyses, find more data, etc. As a researcher, our goal is to know when to stop, while producing work that is scientifically defensible and that we can be proud of. In order to do this, I expect students to work an average of 35 to 40 hours a week - some weeks may be less, some may be more. I do not want to glorify overwork or ‘80-hour’ workweeks, but want to acknowledge that there are many tasks and responsibilities in research, while juggling coursework, teaching, extra-curricular activities, mental health, etc. Depending on your funding and course situation that term, the number of hours per task will change. I want to help you find your preferred work style so that you can ‘work smart’, instead of ‘working long’. Remember that being at work does not mean you’re doing work! To support your work-life balance, I will encourage you to: Experiment and find a set of working hours that works for you early in your graduate studies. Some people thrive in a traditional 9-5, while others prefer to break up their day with an activity (e.g. the gym, club activity, etc.), or longer 4 day workweek. My expectation is that we set the schedule for the term and try to keep to it for planning purposes, but we can always adapt and revisit if it’s not working. a. Fred will typically work 9-5 and expects some overlap for meetings, discussions, etc. Similarly, you will have to be respectful of staff, other students, etc. if you choose to have a non-traditional schedule Plan for up to 14 vacation days per year, in addition to statutory/school holidays. Just be cognizant of class time, exams, etc. Take necessary sick/mental health days and time off for appointments (separate from vacation days) - just let me know! Let Fred know if you require an extended leave of absence. Life happens, and I want to ensure that you are supported during difficult times. When you join the research group, I will ask that you establish points 1) and 2) so that we can coordinate schedules. Please let Fred know if either changes! 2.5 Towards a healthy work-life balance I hope that all members of our group will have flexible work hours (see above) and modes of work (office vs work from home, etc.). Determine your working hours to set boundaries (using ‘Do Not Disturb’ features on Outlook and Slack to assist with that); I will not expect emails/responses from you outside these times. Have a formal check-in every semester to reflect on progress, successes, failures, and opportunities to change course, in addition to regularly scheduled meetings during the semester for more detailed discussions. Don’t hesitate to reach out for impromptu chats. Unless I’m teaching, in a meeting, or have some dedicated scheduled deep-work for a deadline, I am always happy to take a break and chat. I will encourage you to prioritize your physical and mental health and to make time for hobbies and relaxation. Build your ‘support network’. There are many aspects of mentorship (see this link) and I will strive to provide support in most of these areas. However, it is good to have multiple people to increase resilience and diversity in your network. It is common to tie our self-worth to the successes and failures of our research. While it’s good to be proud of the work you do, I hope that you treat this degree as any other job (albeit one where you hopefully learn new things and have fun) 2.6 What to do when your PI is failing you You will spend 4+ years at our research group and there will inadvertently be points of friction. My hope is that they will only be minor issues, but regardless of the scale of the issue, I also hope that you feel comfortable discussing it with me in a timely manner so that we can resolve it together. However, I acknowledge that there is an inherent power dynamic differential in a mentorship relationship and you may not feel comfortable telling me (or for any other reason). In our mentorship agreement, we will have established the primary points of contact (most likely the department chair or graduate director) to help mediate issues.

To make things easier for everyone, I will (force) the research group to use the following tools: Microsoft Outlook for the calendar functionality* Slack for project and general intralab communications (as opposed to email) Github for version control and code storage *you’re free to use any other mail/calendar app! My one request is that you find one that can sync with my Outlook calendar so you can see my availability for meetings to help schedule any 1:1 meetings Other than the things above, you should explore other tools to help you make your time in grad school enjoyable. Based on my own experience, I will highly recommend the following tools for ease of consistency (and general bad experiences with competing products), but you are more than welcome to use an alternative. Task Suggested Program Other Options Manuscript Writing Google Docs/Microsoft Word These programs unfortunately have pros and cons each and are good for different stages of writing a manuscript.

If you’d like a template to start with/adapt, consider using this As a rule of thumb, if you’re stuck on something for more than several hours, seek help! Keeping good documentation of code, data, assumptions. I encourage you to use a combination of a markdown system (RMarkdown, Quarto, Jupyter notebook, etc.) for code and research notebook (e.g. OneNote) I am happy to communicate via Slack messages and face-to-face chats Slack has the benefit of keeping a record of our discussion for posterity, and is great for short/easy questions, dropping interim figures/analyses, etc. Face-to-face is better for in-depth discussions, multiple topics, etc. Keep on top of important dates for degree milestones/forms, conferences, etc. especially if you need feedback/signatures, etc. and tell Fred in advance! "],["tips-for-project-and-time-management.html", "Chapter 5 Tips for Project and Time Management 5.1 Kanban Board/Checklist 5.2 Calendar Time Blocking 5.3 Research Notes 5.4 Footnotes 5.5 Citations", " Chapter 5 Tips for Project and Time Management Graduate studies is quite often a test of time management and you may find that what worked in your undergraduate degree does not work now (or it might!). Additionally, different people work differently and the working style may change over time. Below are some strategies that I’ve tried during my graduate studies - some were extremely helpful, some were less effective. I have found that what works best is whatever system that has the least cognitive load/effort so I can build a habit. I encourage you to find what works best for you, and to also add to this list to help other members in the group. 5.1 Kanban Board/Checklist The Kanban system is essentially a fancy checklist that helps you keep track of tasks, deadlines, and progress with a project. &lt;picture&gt; &lt;software&gt; 5.2 Calendar Time Blocking I actively use my calendar in conjunction with my checklist to make sure I have time in the week to accomplish the task. After mandatory events are filled out (meetings, class, other appointments), I try to block out time periods for specific tasks based on the Kanban board. If tasks are taking more/less time than expected, I can edit the events in my calendar, while seeing if I need to shift other tasks because of it. It’s also helpful to know when you work best for different tasks (deep work vs reading vs coding vs mindless tasks). I encourage you to put in ‘deep work’ blocks in your calendar to protect time from meetings, other tasks. You should feel free to set your calendar to busy and slack/email notifications to Do Not Disturb. 5.3 Research Notes For the sake of reproducibility and your sanity, please keep good notes on your research. You should explore what methods work best for you! While not perfect, I have found that using OneNote has to most versatility and utility for the type of work we do. What I like about OneNote is that it’s 1) easy to jot down notes, 2) copy in figures, code, screenshots, insert pictures of handwritten notes, etc. 3) organize thoughts on project, daily/weekly progress, etc. In our work, it is extremely beneficial to keep note of: sources for data, values for constants assumptions for models procedures/workflows, etc. After publishing a paper, and when you graduate, I expect a copy of your research notes to be stored in the lab. It is of course easier to do if it’s digital, but we can discuss what we can do if you have used a physical notebook. 5.4 Footnotes Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret ^[]. Like this one 1. 5.5 Citations Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using @key. For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2023) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key. The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations References "],["sharing-your-book.html", "Chapter 6 Sharing your book Usage 6.1 Cross References 6.2 Chapters and sub-chapters 6.3 Captioned figures and tables 6.4 Parts 6.5 Citations 6.6 Publishing 6.7 404 pages 6.8 Metadata for sharing", " Chapter 6 Sharing your book This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 6.1 Cross References Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book. 6.2 Chapters and sub-chapters There are two steps to cross-reference any heading: Label the heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}. Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 2. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 6.3 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 6.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 6.1: Here is a nice figure!

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers. ## Footnotes Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret `^[]`. Like this one ^[This is a footnote.]. 6.5 Citations Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using `@key`. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015] (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the `.bib` files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML `bibliography` key. The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations ## Equations Here is an equation. \\begin{equation} f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k} (\\#eq:binom) \\end{equation} You may refer to using `\\@ref(eq:binom)`, like see Equation (??). ## Theorems and proofs Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using `\\@ref(thm:tri)`, for example, check out this smart theorem 6.1. Theorem 6.1 For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the *length* of the hypotenuse and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the **other** two sides, we have $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ Read more here https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html. ## Callout blocks The R Markdown Cookbook provides more help on how to use custom blocks to design your own callouts: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html 6.6 Publishing HTML books can be published online, see: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/publishing.html 6.7 404 pages By default, users will be directed to a 404 page if they try to access a webpage that cannot be found. If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 6.8 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
